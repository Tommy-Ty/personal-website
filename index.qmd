Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student of political science, currently studying at the [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). I am also a research assistant at the [Fudan Institute for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences](https://ias.fudan.edu.cn). 

My major is political science, and my current research interests lie in historical political economy, historical sociology, and social science methodology. Specifically, I am interested in state capacity, state building, authoritarianism, conflict and war, as well as quantitative research methods and machine learning in social science research.

**About My Name**

My name is Runze Tai, written in Chinese as 「臺潤澤」. "Tai (臺)" is my family name, and "Runze (潤澤)" is my given name. For readers unfamiliar with Chinese, the Yale romanization *Tai-Rhuen-Dze* may better approximate the pronunciation for English speakers.
