Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student of political science, currently studying at the [School of International Relations and Public Affairs](https://sirpa.fudan.edu.cn) of [Fudan University](https://fudan.edu.cn). I am also a research assistant at the [Fudan Institute for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences](https://ias.fudan.edu.cn). 

My major is Comparative Politics, and my current research interests lie in historical political economy, historical sociology, and social science methodology. Specifically, I am interested in state capacity, state building, authoritarianism, conflict and war, as well as quantitative research methods and machine learning in social science research.
